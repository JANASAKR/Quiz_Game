This is a complete Quiz Game designed as a simple console application. In this project, a few questions 
are asked (this question is talked about object-oriented programming), and the user is awarded points for 
each correct answer given is 20.
In this quiz game, you can store the username. Additionally, to make the game look a little more 
interesting, it is divided into two levels, user must pass the first level to reach the second level and user 
must have a code of level 1 to play level 2.
In the level one, the user is asked a total of five simple questions, and they must be able to answer at 
least three of them correctly (mean the number of points to enter the level two must be greater than
50) If the user is not capable of doing that, he is not permitted to enter level two.
The game ends when the user pass level two. For each question asked, there are 4 options, namely A, 
B, C and D. There are no negative markings, so the userâ€™s points are constant for wrong answers to the 
questions.
